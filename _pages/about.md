I recently earned my **PhD in Atmospheric Science** from the **University of Washington**, working with <a href="https://orca.atmos.washington.edu/">Professor Shuyi Chen</a>. My research focused on the physical processes by which the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) influences the variability of the eastern edge of the warm pool and contributes to the early development of El Niño. My PhD work was a processes-based study that used in-situ observations, satellite-derived datasets, and high-resolution atmosphere-ocean coupled model simulations, aiming to understand better the multiscale air-sea interactions  of the MJO and ENSO interaction. For more, take a look at my **<a href="/assets/pdf/cv2024.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>** or <a href="/publications">publications</a>.

During my graduate years at UW, I actively contributed to the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) and the Observing Air-sea Interactions Strategy (OASIS), demonstrating my commitment to the advancement of our field. I also had the privilege of collaborating with my advisor and scientists from NOAA PMEL on designing an international field campaign scheduled for 2026, further showcasing my dedication to practical research and application.

At the intersection of observations, modeling, and machine learning, I explore the **intricate and complex MJO-ENSO interaction from the perspective of the air-sea interactive processes**. One of my **science passions** is to enhance our understanding of physical processes in both the atmosphere and ocean and how they are or will change in response of global warming. Understanding these governing processes of these interactions is paramount for refining the representation of such physical processes in fully coupled models, thereby enhancing the accuracy of ENSO representation and prediction.
