Hello! Thanks for visiting my website :) 

I'm an Atmospheric Scientist with background in tropical meteorology, climate variability, and air-sea interactions. At the intersection of observations, modeling, and machine learning my research aims to advance our understanding of key physical processes in the atmosphere and ocean and how they are evolving under global warming. Gaining deeper insights into these interactions is crucial for improving their representation in fully coupled models, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy, with the ultimate goal of benefiting vulnerable communities. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science – Data Science option from the University of Washington (UW) in 2024, where I investigated the complex interactions between the Madden-Julian Oscillation and El Niño onset, with a particular focus on how large-scale freshwater fluxes influence ocean currents in the equatorial western Pacific warm pool. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at CICOES, working with Dr. Chidong Zhang at NOAA PMEL’s Ocean Climate Research Division and Professor Shuyi Chen at UW. My research aims to enhance atmospheric river (AR) prediction capabilities by integrating GPS retrievals with satellite observations and Numerical Weather Prediction datasets, helping to reduce biases associated with AR events. Beyond my research on ARs, I am involved in the planning of the upcoming TPOS Equatorial Pacific Experiment (TEPEX) field campaign, scheduled for 2026-2027, contributing to efforts that will improve our understanding of tropical ocean-atmosphere interactions.
