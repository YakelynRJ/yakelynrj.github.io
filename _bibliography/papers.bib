abstract = {{Enhanced warm pool eastward extension (WPEE) over the western‐central Pacific prior to the onset of El Niño has been observed following Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) precipitation events. However, the mechanism driving the WPEE after the MJO precipitation remains unclear. This study investigates how MJO precipitation affects WPEE by analyzing the zonal momentum budget of two coupled atmosphere‐ocean model simulations with and without freshwater from Kerns and Chen (2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2021.101892). It is found that the zonal pressure gradient (ZPG) force created by decreasing salinity and density from MJO precipitation is a key driving force of the WPEE during the onset of El Niño in 2018. The ZPG forces eastward density currents, transporting warmer and fresher waters against persistent easterly winds. Eastward density currents can persist for up to 30 days post‐MJO precipitation. This new mechanism works in concert with two other well‐known MJO‐induced processes in the upper ocean: (a) deepening of thermocline by oceanic Kelvin waves excited by the MJO's westerly winds, and (b) increased SST due to the barrier layer formation. The cumulative effects of these interactive processes during consecutive MJO events reduce the Pacific basin‐scale east‐west temperature gradient, enhancing the WPEE. These processes can contribute to flattening the east‐west thermocline, decreasing in upwelling in the central Pacific, and warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific. It is well known that the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) and El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affect global high‐impact weather and climate extreme events. In this study, we found that the MJO contributes to the start of El Niño by increasing sea surface temperature in the western Pacific and moving its warm water eastward in favor of developing El Niño. We use a high‐resolution coupled atmosphere‐ocean model representing the MJO precipitation realistically and its effects on the upper ocean. We show that rainfall from the MJO injects a large amount of freshwater into the ocean. It helps maintain surface warm water by forming a barrier layer that prevents the upwelling of cooler water from the deeper ocean. Furthermore, the warmer surface water propagates eastward for weeks after the MJO rainfall. This happens because freshwater increases the zonal density gradient and pressure difference, which forces eastward surface currents to carry warm water farther east than the MJO. Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) precipitation and freshwater forcing induce ocean density currents that persist for weeks after the MJO rainfall Ocean density currents are mainly driven by zonal pressure gradients due to decreased salinity and increased east‐west density differences The long‐lasting eastward density currents contribute to the warm pool eastward extension prior to the onset of El Niño Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) precipitation and freshwater forcing induce ocean density currents that persist for weeks after the MJO rainfall Ocean density currents are mainly driven by zonal pressure gradients due to decreased salinity and increased east‐west density differences The long‐lasting eastward density currents contribute to the warm pool eastward extension prior to the onset of El Niño}},

abstract = {{Coarse‐grid weather and climate models rely particularly on parameterizations of cloud fields, and coarse‐grained cloud fields from a fine‐grid reference model are a natural target for a machine‐learned parameterization. We machine‐learn the coarsened‐fine cloud properties as a function of coarse‐grid model state in each grid cell of NOAA's FV3GFS global atmosphere model with 200 km grid spacing, trained using a 3 km fine‐grid reference simulation with a modified version of FV3GFS. The ML outputs are coarsened‐fine fractional cloud cover and liquid and ice cloud condensate mixing ratios, and the inputs are coarse model temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and ice cloud condensate. The predicted fields are skillful and unbiased, but somewhat under‐dispersed, resulting in too many partially cloudy model columns. When the predicted fields are applied diagnostically (offline) in FV3GFS's radiation scheme, they lead to small biases in global‐mean top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative fluxes. An unbiased global‐mean TOA net radiative flux is obtained by setting to zero any predicted cloud with grid‐cell mean cloud fraction less than a threshold of 6.5\%; this does not significantly degrade the ML prediction of cloud properties. The diagnostic, ML‐derived radiative fluxes are far more accurate than those obtained with the existing cloud parameterization in the nudged coarse‐grid model, as they leverage the accuracy of the fine‐grid reference simulation's cloud properties. Weather and climate models typically use simplified means of predicting clouds, and these methods are particularly important for models that run at coarse resolution (200 km pixels) and relatively quickly. Machine learning is a natural way to improve upon the methods of predicting cloud. We first show that detailed cloud information from an accurate model run at much finer resolution (3 km pixels) can produce more accurate radiative energy fluxes at earth's surface and top of atmosphere when used in the coarse model, instead of its own predicted clouds. We show that by training on the temperature, humidity, and other characteristics of the coarse model, machine learning can replicate much of this skill in predicting clouds, and provide better radiation estimates than traditional methods. Because solar and thermal radiation is sensitive to small amounts of cloud, we find that we need to remove small amounts erroneously predicted by machine learning to achieve the right amounts of radiation at earth's surface and top of atmosphere. The machine‐learning based approach could be used as a replacement for the current statistical methods of predicting cloud fields in fast, coarse‐resolution weather and climate models. Fine‐grid model clouds, when coarsened, can produce more accurate radiative fluxes than a coarse model's own parameterized clouds Machine learning can capture the coarsened fine‐grid clouds as functions of coarse model state (temperature, pressure, and humidity) With appropriate post‐processing, the machine‐learned clouds also outperform the coarse model's clouds in terms of diagnostic radiation Fine‐grid model clouds, when coarsened, can produce more accurate radiative fluxes than a coarse model's own parameterized clouds Machine learning can capture the coarsened fine‐grid clouds as functions of coarse model state (temperature, pressure, and humidity) With appropriate post‐processing, the machine‐learned clouds also outperform the coarse model's clouds in terms of diagnostic radiation}},
